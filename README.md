# AngularTestSite
My first Angular site.

To generate an Angular component, execute the following command:

ng generate (or g) component (or c) component-path/name-of-component (like products/product-detail) --flat (if you don't want a folder created)

This component will come with 4 files:

(a) (name-of-component).component.html
(b) (name-of-component).component.spec.ts
(c) (name-of-component).component.ts
(d) (name-of-component).component.css
